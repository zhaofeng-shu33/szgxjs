# How to run
This project used Baidu Map API to render the background. As a result, to successfully render the html source file, you need to have to modify the `ak` secret key to your own and upload the file to a server if necessary.
Then use a browser to access the address.

Currently, the interactive effect is available at [http://data-visualization.leidenschaft.cn/volunteer_programming/join.html](http://data-visualization.leidenschaft.cn/volunteer_programming/join.html) but the server maintainer
does not guarantee that this url is accessible in the future.

# How to interact
You can choose between keyboard and mouse. For keyboard, press `1` to `8` to switch between different universities and press `9` to show the river coverage effect.
Finnally, press `0` to show the effect of accumulation. For mouse operation, just press the corresponding logo at the bottom of the webpage.
